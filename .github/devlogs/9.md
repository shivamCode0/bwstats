Devlog 9: Usage Milestone

BWStats is now serving around 1000 queries daily.

The traffic is surprisingly consistent - mostly players checking their own stats and comparing with friends. Popular searches include well-known YouTubers and streamers, but the majority are regular players.

Redis cache hit rate is staying around 75% which keeps everything running smoothly. Most popular pages are individual player profiles, followed by the leaderboards.

Seeing users from all over the world. The 3D skin viewer seems to be a major draw - people spend way more time on profile pages than I expected.

Pretty surreal watching something I built in my room being used by thousands of Minecraft players every day.
