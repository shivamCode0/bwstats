Devlog 2: User Page + Skinviewer

Got the user profile pages working! The 3D skin viewer is probably my favorite feature - using react-skinview3d to render actual Minecraft skins with smooth rotation animations.

API integration was tricky but rewarding. PlayerDB.co converts usernames to UUIDs, then I hit Hypixel's API for the stats. They return 50+ metrics per game mode which is incredible.

Built proper error handling and loading states since API calls can be slow. The stats are organized into cards covering all Bedwars modes - solos, doubles, 4v4s, armed, lucky, ultimate, voidless.

PlayerSkinView component is only 35 lines but transforms how the page feels.

Screenshot idea: User profile with 3D skin viewer on left, stats cards on right.
