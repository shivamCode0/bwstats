Devlog 1: Home Page + Icons

Started building a Bedwars stats tracker using Next.js 15 and React 19. Chose Bun over npm for faster installs and Tailwind CSS for styling.

The homepage has a clean search interface with example usernames and stores recent searches in localStorage. Using 14 different Minecraft background images that rotate randomly.

Icon system uses Lucide React - lightning bolt for fast search, trending arrow for analytics, users icon for rankings. Everything has this glassmorphism design with backdrop blur effects.

ClientHomePage component handles the search logic and the whole thing feels snappy.

Screenshot idea: Homepage with search bar and feature cards showing the icons.
