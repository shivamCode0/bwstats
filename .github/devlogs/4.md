Devlog 4: Responsive Design + SEO

Made the entire app responsive and added comprehensive SEO. Mobile layout was trickier than expected - had to stack the skin viewer and stats vertically instead of side by side.

Built dynamic OpenGraph image generation using @vercel/og. Each player page now generates custom social media previews showing their username, level, and key stats.

Added proper meta tags with player-specific descriptions and comprehensive keywords. URLs are clean with /user/username structure for better search indexing.

Everything scales from mobile to desktop using Tailwind breakpoints. Navigation adapts and cards reflow properly on smaller screens.

Screenshot idea: Split screen showing desktop vs mobile layout of the same user page.
