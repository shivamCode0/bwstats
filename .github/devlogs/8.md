Devlog 8: Project Summary

Built a complete Bedwars stats tracker from scratch in 7 weeks.

Started with Next.js 15 and React 19, built homepage with search functionality and glassmorphism design. Added 3D skin viewer using react-skinview3d and comprehensive stats from Hypixel API.

Created leaderboards for all 5 categories with color-coded designs. Made everything responsive and implemented dynamic OpenGraph images for SEO.

Added Redis caching that reduced API calls by 80% and improved load times from 2 seconds to 50ms. Achieved #1 Google rankings for major keywords.

Had to implement bot protection after traffic attack drained resources, but now everything runs smoothly.

The app tracks 50+ metrics across all Bedwars modes and serves thousands of users daily.
