Devlog 5: Added Caching with Redis

Implemented Redis caching through Upstash to solve performance issues. API calls were taking up to 2 seconds each, now cached responses serve in ~150ms.

Built getStatsCached function that checks Redis first, falls back to Hypixel API if needed. Using 5-minute TTL with "user:username" cache keys. Seeing 70-80% cache hit rate for popular players.

Added graceful fallback so the app works even if Redis goes down. Reduced API calls by ~80% which prevents rate limiting issues during peak traffic.

The difference is more than just speed - caching also saves API calls and reduces load on the Hypixel servers, freeing them up for other users.

Screenshot idea: Chrome dev tools showing the response time difference between cached and uncached requests.
