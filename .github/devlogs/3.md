Devlog 3: Leaderboards Page

Built the leaderboards page with all 5 Hypixel categories - level, total wins, weekly wins, final kills, and weekly final kills.

Each leaderboard has its own color scheme and icon. Level gets blue gradients with a star, wins get green with crowns, kills get red with trending arrows. Keeps the same glassmorphism design as the rest of the site.

Made it client-side rendered for better interactivity. Cards have hover effects and scale properly on mobile. Added estimated player counts to give context on competition size.

Used the constants file for leaderboard names and ordering to keep everything consistent.

Screenshot idea: Full leaderboards page showing all 5 cards in grid layout.
