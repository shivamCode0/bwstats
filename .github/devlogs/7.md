Devlog 7: Bot Attack

BW Stats got hit by a massive bot attack that drained my entire Vercel free tier.

Traffic spiked to thousands of requests per minute for weeks without me noticing. Burned through all my bandwidth and compute credits.

Implemented Cloudflare firewall with bot challenges. Traffic immediately dropped to normal levels and legitimate users can still access everything.

Lesson learned: monitor your dashboards regularly.
