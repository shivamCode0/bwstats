So for this project I know I already have coded it but I want to submit it for a student coding program. But I have to add devlogs for updates along the way. But the app is already done and not in development. So I want you to write devlogs as if it was being developed. I need 5 devlogs. Each devlog should include a few sentences and/or bullet points. Also include an idea of a picture I can include (most likely a screenshot of a certain part of the app but the student platform also supports video and gifs). The devlogs should be in chronological order from start to finish of the project. Here are the 5 milestones I want you to write devlogs for:

1. Home Page + Icons (created app in Next.js with tailwind css and bun and made a home page with a search bar and icons for the main game modes)
2. User Page + Skinviewer (made a user page that shows stats and a skinviewer component to show the player's skin in 3d)
3. Leaderboards Page (made a leaderboards page that shows the top players by level, wins, and final kills and includes all 5 leaderboards provided by the hypixel api)
4. Responsive Design + SEO (made the app responsive for mobile and desktop and added seo optimizations including OG image)
5. Added caching with redis to reduce api calls and speed up the app

Save everything to .github/devlogs/{n}.md in the root of the project. Make sure you read relevant files relating to each devlog in order to provide a detailed devlog that is also accurate. So for example for 1 I would expect you to read package.json and the home page files so you know what you are talking about. You must scour this repository and become an expert in it by the end. Read everything you need.
